put id_extra inside Options

make widget functions optional with defaults

text editing
- make TextEntryWidget wrap a scrollarea and TextLayout
  - TextEntryWidget gets focus (and tabindex), when it processes events, it sends unhandled events directly to TextLayout's processEvent function

TextLayout support for large documents
- need a function to say "we are skipping a bunch of bytes" (might be useful for code folding as well)
- addTextDone needs to not always set cursor because there might be lots of text remaining that we aren't rendering

maybe if a widget gets a mouse event outside its rect, clear the remaining key event's focus_widgetId?  Assume we lost focus?

use zig package manager to get SDL (github.com/andrewrk/SDL)
- build the same SDL version to get cmake config

get mach example working again


add alpha to Options as well and multiply it by the theme alpha

example toast that includes "undo"

add disabled to options so the seek forward/backward icons can be grayed out?
- need to add ability to gray out things too (alpha to options?)
- is disabled just a visual thing?
  - can still tab/click on it?
- when disabled, can't tab to that thing?
  - if focused and disabled, call tabIndexNext


can't format {d:02} needs {d:0>2}?

add backend function to allow screensaver

audit backends for how to use them on top of an existing app

separate background and border drawing:
- embed a convex polygon triangulator?  Will need for arbitrary pathing in any case
- can draw border by walking along both arcs in parallel trying to keep the angle of the line between the points alternating around 45 deg

cross-widget dragging (for stuff like docking)
- dragPreStart and dragStart take a ?[]const u8 ("_dock")
- dragging also takes a ?[]const u8
  - will return the point if either widget has mouse capture or string matches
- widgets that only do mouse capture dragging can pass null
- other widgets have to coordinate via the string
  - need to be able to call dragging outside of processing events so you can change appearance if the drag you are interested in is happening

for normal animations should be able to do a wrapper widget
- can animate from 0 to min_size (gotten from deinit)
- can deanimate from current size to 0
- floating windows are different since they aren't in the normal flow
 - need a special wrapper for them which doesn't insert itself into the heirarchy just adjusts values

scrolling to show something
- bubble event (scroll_to_point) asking any scrollarea to scroll so a given screen point is visible
  - scrollarea checks if point is already visible, if not whether it can scroll in that direction
  - optional whether to jump or to scroll smoothly
  - scrollarea sets a field on bubbled event saying if this needs to be done again next frame (if smoothscrolling and made progress)

scroll test vertical .none

scrollbar should separate install and events like normal, so you could put it on top of the scroll area contents:
  - create it but with a given rect (which should always disable rectFor and minSizeForChild)
  - run events
  - do all the rest of the scroll area children
  - then do the drawing
    - all widgets should separate the rendering like this so that you can wrap them around children (process events before but render after)

look into logging, how to use it in general and how to use it for gui stuff?
- const scope_name = std.log.scoped(.whatever);
- Then define a log function with the appropriate signature in your root file?
- maybe can use WidgetData.init to help with logging or debug mode?

how can I get mach to not build all it's stuff when I'm compiling an sdl example?
- need for it to do the work in a build step rather than when the build step is being made

-Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding-none

mach-test: no tab key?

linux mach-test: moving GUI Demo window around lags

try splitting into 2 files - gui.zig (has widgets and re-exports core stuff) and gui-core.zig (has stuff widgets depend on)

more docs
- tabindex
- seamless animations

start making real demo() contents
- document stuff inside there?
- following dear imgui demo
 - Basic Widgets
  - radio
  - hold-repeat buttons
  - tooltips
  - dropdown selection
- mouse cursors
- gravity
- themes

Tooltips:
- wrapper around thing you want the tooltip for
- floating windows similar to popup
- popup has 3-4 states:
  - ready (on first frame where the mouse pointer is above the rect, go to 
  showing)
  - timer (could go here and wait for timer)
  - showing (tooltip popup shows, go to off if the mouse pointer is not 
  above rect)
  - off (go to ready on a frame where the mouse pointer is off our rect)
  var ttw = ToolTipWidget.init...
- if (ttw.active()) |p| {
    // p is the point of the mouse when the tooltip was activated
    var ttp = TooltipPopupWidget.init... (pass in TooltipWidget's screenrect, optionally previous ttp if nested)
    // ttp
    ttp.install();
    // tooltip contents
    ttp.deinit();
    // ttp.deinit() checks:
      - if we have a live nested ttp, we stay alive
      - if the current mouse pointer is not above ttp OR the passed in ttw screenrect, we stay alive
      - if staying alive and we have a ttp parent, tell that parent we are live
  }

problem of mousing off a menuItem and onto the theme change checkbox, and the menuItem stays highlighted
- when a mouse motion event in a Menu happens:
  - if "towards" an open submenu:
    - Menu eats the event and nothing else happens
  - otherwise it's passed to children:
      - if it's on a MenuItem, focus it
      - if not, and the MenuItem is focused, defocus it
  - but that means that as you mouse off the edge, when the mouse goes into the margin, it will defocus the menu item?
  - have to implement intention-motion MenuItem (de)activation to fix this


test what happens if std.time.nanoTimestamp() jumps backwards or forwards
- if backwards just a tiny bit, stay on frame_time_ns?
- if backwards more (or forwards a lot), reset frame_time_ns and also shift any animations?
- check begin() and beginWait()


text input support in mach
clipboard support in mach

xstart and ystart for textSize

kerning
- check how sdl_ttf does it

popup needs to align it's text with the label that popped it
- take a flag for whether it's popping updown or sideways, then adjust x or y to account for border and padding

switch to adwaita default font?

mach: do clipping in the shader?

premultiplied alpha for all textures (and vertices from PathStroke/Fill?)
- also font glyphs

when we have a widget that has captured the mouse, need to capture the mouse in the underlying window system so click-dragging works even when the mouse pointer goes outside the window

punchlist for podcast app:
- bitmaps
- textentry needs to be able to paste a url

some visual indication of non-focused windows
- maybe change focus color inside?

debugging:
- highlight widgets that are causing cueFrames?
- show layout somehow (mouseover?)
- maybe just a separate floating window that shows a tree-view of all the widgets
  - mouseover to highlight the widget?

hover and highlight properties need to propogate down to children so that icons can draw properly in buttons where the button is highlighted but not the icon directly?
  - maybe as part of the Options struct?


PathStroking with thickness
- endcaps?
- need to adjust points if they are too close together or angle is too acute
  - on acute angle side and do line intersection
    - so we have points a,b,c where b is the current intersection point above p
    - if the angle from p to a is on the wrong side of b, then project a onto the line from p to b to ensure convexness
  - on other side, do line intersection
    - but set some maximum on the length of the point from p


dialog
- maybe a flag on floatingwindow?
- have a separate function that does the nextWindowCleanup
  - always call in deinit, but also user can call that and get result if the user pressed esc
  - are there other things a user could press?
- rss textentry should bubble up the enter that it doesn't process so the dialog can record that it should "submit"

popups need to have a scrollarea
- scrollarea needs to not show the scrollbar if no need
- also main window and floating windows
- probably default layouts for those should be a vertical scrollarea with showing the scrollbar only when needed (and when not showing it don't scroll past the beginning or end)

maybe use stb_truetype or whatever so we don't need sdl_ttf?
- translate-c is failing for a few of the functions

change cursorlayout from top-to-bottom to left-to-right with optional extra floating widgets that get routed around
- save info for each line
  - size and baseline offset
  - height is max of (height of items without baseline) and max of (max of baselines, max of underhangs) of items with baselines
  - if new size/baseline is different, cueFrame()
- replace menubar horizontal box with textlayout so that lots of menus will wrap

baseline alignment
- maybe only inside TextLayout?
- vertical alignment needs additional .baseline
- rectFor provides baseline float offset from top of rect
- minSize needs to send baseline offset
- PlaceIn honors .baseline alignment

make Alt do special stuff with the menubar

need to free widgets that are allocated on the arena
- like TextWidget does it

scroll widget when stuff is being added/deleted
- lock to top if there previously
- scroll to bottom if there previously
- otherwise scroll to widget that was in the middle?
